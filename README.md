# 2048 Recreation

Welcome to my recreation of the classic 2048 game! This project is a Unity-based implementation of the popular sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

- Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch.

- Each move, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.

- The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 is created.

- The game is over when no more moves are possible.
